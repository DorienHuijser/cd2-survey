  This repository contains the code to process raw
  data from the Connecting Data in Child Development
  (CD2) project's vocabularies survey for each
  participating cohort study into a much more
  readable and useful format. The goal of this survey
  is to develop a harmonized vocabulary that can be
  used in the to be built CD2 metadata portal, where
  the data from 6 developmental child cohorts will be
  represented.
